bootstrap-modal-form
====================

A simple jQuery extension that turns a link into a Bootstrap 3 modal form launcher. Based on graceful degradation rules.

This plugin is similar to the default functionality of Bootstrap 3 for remote form modals.  This plugin builds on that functioanlity to provide a better experience and encapsulates several hook events.
